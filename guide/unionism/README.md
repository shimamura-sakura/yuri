# Example - [Unionism Quartet](https://vndb.org/v15288)

## Main parameters
- Custom build based on version `0.480` (the version the .YBN files are based on, so when decompiling and recompiling those, the program needs to be informed of this value)
- YPF files: `0.500` (This is seen on any file of the .ypf files)
- YBN files: `0.554` (This is what the game's executable reports)
- YSTB decryption key: `0x9C28430C` (This is needed to decrypt the files included in ysbin.ypf. When recreating the ysbin.ypf file, the game accepts a null key.)

## Other parameters
- Standard in *yuricom.run* `npar` (`opts=yuricom.ComOpts(opt_v555_npar=False)`)
